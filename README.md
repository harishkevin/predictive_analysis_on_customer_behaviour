# predictive_analysis_on_customer_behaviour
demonstrated how to increase accuracy with feature engineering



Overview: The task is to predict the customer behaviour weather they buy the product or not. But the problem is we only have three features (Age, Income, Gender). So I'vs done feature engineering to add extra features(High Income, Old Age, Young Age) from the excisting features.

Phases of Work: 
1. The data is downloaded from kaggle.
2. A pipeline is built to preprocess the data.
3. First the model is trained without feature engineering. The accuracy was 80%.
4. Then the model is trained with the new features. The accuracy increased to 85%
5. 
Metrics for Evaluating: Accuracy is used for evaluation. The model returned 85% acuracy with the new features.
